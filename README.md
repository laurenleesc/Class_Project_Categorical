This repository is for the manuscript for Dr. Ray's class.

proposal.tex is a LaTex document.  It is a very simple proposal format that we can submit 10/28 if necessary.  We will hopefully not use this file after approval.

main.tex is the real working paper.  Please add headings, delete headings, anything you would like. My intent was to facilitate getting started, not to dictate.

reference.bib is a LaTex file that is editable with notebpad.  It is referenced by the main.tex file.  Please add your citations here as you reference them in your writing.
